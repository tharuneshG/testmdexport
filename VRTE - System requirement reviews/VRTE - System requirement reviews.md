# VRTE - System requirement reviews - v2.0

- [ ] <strong>Attributes</strong>

  - [ ] Are all system requirements either accepted, rejected or marked as obsolete?

  - [ ] Are verification criteria defined for each accepted system requirement? Are these verification criteria either realistically testable or can be satisfied by a design inspection?

- [ ] <strong>Content</strong>

  - [ ] <em><strong>Clear-cut:</strong></em> Each requirement shall only be interpretable an unambiguous way.

  - [ ] <em><strong>Realizable:</strong></em> No requirement shall contradict unchangeable environment conditions.

  - [ ] <em><strong>Comprehensible:</strong></em> Requirements shall be formulated in a way which can be understood when reading them only once.

  - [ ] <em><strong>Solution-neutral:</strong></em> Requirements shall always address the problem space, not the solution space.

  - [ ] <em><strong>Correct:</strong></em> Requirements shall be formulated in a way which leads to the same understanding of this requirement on both the requestor and requirements engineer side.

  - [ ] <em><strong>Atomic:</strong></em> Each requirement shall express only a single need.

  - [ ] Are the keywords defined in RFC2119 (must, shall, should, may&hellip;) used according to the semantics defined in this standard? Are they used in natural case (e.g. &quot;shall&quot; not &quot;SHALL&quot;) and are the keywords &quot;must&quot; and &quot;must not&quot; only used if the related requirement is enforced by law?

- [ ] <strong>Links</strong>

  - [ ] Is it made clear which corresponding customer/stakeholder requirements are satisfied by each accepted system requirement (mandatory if applicable)?

  - [ ] Is each accepted system requirement linked to the corresponding test cases in RQM?

  - [ ] Is each accepted system requirement related to a corresponding work item in CCM?

- [ ] <strong>Name</strong>

  - [ ] Does the system requirements module name stick to the defined naming convention?
