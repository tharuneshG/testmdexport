# VRTE - Features Review - v2.0

- [ ] <strong>Attributes</strong>

  - [ ] Are all features either accepted or marked as obsolete?

  - [ ] Is the comment attribute empty (we don&#39;t use it for features)?

- [ ] <strong>Content</strong>

  - [ ] High level of abstraction, yet tangible? Ultimate technical precision is a non-goal!

  - [ ] Easily understandable also for non-experts?

  - [ ] Addresses a concrete (potential) customer need (e.g. &quot;Carries weekend luggage of 4 persons&quot; instead of &quot;Trunk available&quot;?)

  - [ ] Is it clear what the customer wins by ordering a particular feature and what he or she loses by not ordering it?

  - [ ] Can each feature also serve as a roadmap item?

  - [ ] Are the cross-cutting aspects standards conformance, configuration, safety, and security covered (if applicable)?

  - [ ] Are the features in a feature module hierarchically structured using sensible headlines (which are often related to a single product feature in case of function cluster features)?

  - [ ] Digestable amount of features per feature module?

- [ ] <strong>Links</strong>

  - [ ] <em><strong>Only for accepted function cluster features:</strong></em> is it made clear which corresponding product feature is satisfied by each function cluster feature (mandatory if applicable)?

  - [ ] Is each accepted feature related to a unique corresponding work item in CCM?

- [ ] <strong>Name</strong>

  - [ ] Does the feature module name stick to the defined naming convention?
