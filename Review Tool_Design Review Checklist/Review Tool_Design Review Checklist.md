- [ ] General
  - [ ] Does the design support both product and project goals?
  - [ ] Does this design have architectural impact?
  - [ ] Does this change have high-level design impact or just low level design impact?
  - [ ] Is the design feasible from a technology, cost, and schedule standpoint?
  - [ ] Is the design consistent with existing modules and functionalities of ReviewTool
  - [ ] Have known design risks been identified, analyzed, and planned for or mitigated?
  - [ ] Were proven past designs reused?
  - [ ] Have proper fallback consideration been made?
  - [ ] Is the revision history updated properly?
  - [ ] Is the Table of Contents and Figures properly updated?
- [ ] Design Considerations
  - [ ] Is the design flexible enough to accommodate and forecast requirement changes
  - [ ] Is the design common for all business units? If not is it mentioned properly in the document
  - [ ] Is the design corroborated with UML diagrams
  - [ ] For low level design: Does the files (JavaScript, Java, sass, html, properties) involved in design documented properly?
  - [ ] Is DB tables, schema, columns and views involved are documented properly for LLDs and HLDs if applicable
  - [ ] Is the drawbacks or constraints for the design documented?
  - [ ] Is the design unjustifiably complex? Is the solution introduces more complexity than the inherent complexity defined in problem?
  - [ ] Is the design lean? Can the design be made leaner?
  - [ ] Have all interfacing systems been identified and documented?
  - [ ] Is there any alternate design considered and documented with advantages and disadvantages?
  - [ ] Does the design allow for scalability? Will the design have effect on a surge in users or requests to Tool?

  - [ ] Is there any DAR created before arriving at solution. If yes, Is the DAR checked-in to RTC and link provided in Traceability
- [ ] Performance Reliability
  - [ ] Are all performance attributes, assumptions, and constraints clearly defined?
  - [ ] If appropriate, are there justifications for design performance?
  - [ ] Will the design cause performance issues for other modules which are cited in impacted modules?
- [ ] Maintainability
  - [ ] Is the design clear and descriptive enough to be understandable for fresh members in the team
  - [ ] If reusable parts of other designs are being used, has their effect on design and integration been documented?
